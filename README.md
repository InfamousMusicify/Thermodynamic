__How to Use Cryo-Bomb:__  
  
    Place a Blue Ice block on a Magma Block and it will create a Cryo-Bomb, 
    the blast will turn nearby water/lava to its solid form.  
    
    Place Packed Ice next to Magma to create a mini Cryo-Bomb! 
    (turns lava to magma, freezes less water)  
    Standing to close may hurt!  

__How to Use Thermite:__  

    Place a Ancient Debris on a Magma Block and it will create Thermite, 
    the reaction will turn nearby Obsidian into Magma.  
    Water and Ice nearby will be evaporated.  
    Standing to close may hurt!
